## 🌟 About

This repository contains my **personal solutions** to assignments and exercises from the CS201 course.

Beyond coursework, it serves as a space where I explore and implement **additional algorithms** studied in CS333 and related topics — a continuously evolving **algorithmic laboratory**.

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

All original course materials and problem sets belong to the **CS201 instructors** and the official course repository owner.

This repository contains only my own implementations and **does not claim ownership** of the original assignments or course content.

Full credit for the course design and materials goes to the respective instructors and maintainers.

## 💡 Philosophy

Algorithms are best understood through **implementation, experimentation, and refinement**.  
This repository reflects that iterative learning process — a blend of theory and practice, constantly evolving.
